                with you and CAT2IIM has played a great role in my CAT 2022
                preparation. I could score 97.82%tile and join IIM Shillong just
                because of your constant guidance, motivation and short tricks.
                I want to express my sincere appreciation to CAT2IIM and Manoj
                Sir for the one-to-one mentoring sessions provided during my CAT
                preparation. The personalised guidance and short tricks shared
                were incredibly effective in enhancing my problem-solving
                skills. The phase-wise strategy and structured plan for mocks
                were particularly beneficial, giving me a clear roadmap to
                follow and helping me track my progress effectively. This
                approach not only improved my confidence but also ensured I was
                well-prepared for each phase of the preparation. Thank you for
                your unwavering support and for equipping me with the tools I
                need to succeed in the CAT 2022 & SNAP 2022 (97.84%tile) exam.`,

    text: `For someone like me who quit maths after class 10 and didn't even remember the basics. Your motivation to slowly work on basics and then on advance really helped. 

The USP of your classes is that you sit with each student, identify there deficiency and give a customised preparation strategy. The best investment if you want to crack CAT/NMAT/XAT. 

If you're not good in Quant and LR, you will need a preparation and exam strategy. Join him, it's a no brainer.

Having spent a year at NMIMS Mumbai, I must say that persistence is the name of the game if you want to succeed. 
I had days when I almost gave up but Manoj Sir pushed to keep moving forward. Thank you Manoj Sir.`,

CAT2IIM grooms you not just to face the exam, but also guides you in each and every step of the exam. The level of personal attention and guidance you give to any student is really difficult to find anywhere else. Hat's off to your hardwork!

After joining IIM Udaipur my life had been very different, the transition from being a Doctor to a MBA student is very enriching and exciting.`,

    text: `Joining Manoj Sir's online classes at CAT2IIM was a turning point in my journey to crack CAT, XAT, and GMAT. Attending his sessions from the comfort of my home, I found myself learning in a way that was both engaging and incredibly effective. Manoj Sir has a unique way of breaking down complex concepts, making even the toughest topics seem manageable.

But what truly sets him apart is his genuine care for his students' success. He didn't just focus on the academics; he was deeply involved in every aspect of my preparation. From nailing down my test strategies to perfecting my essays and honing my interview skills, Manoj Sir was there every step of the way.

When I started receiving interview calls from ISB, SPJIMR, BITSOM, IMT Ghaziabad, and several IIMs, including the new and baby IIMs, it felt like a dream come true. But I knew it wasn’t just luck—it was the result of consistent guidance and support. Manoj Sir’s approach to mentorship was personal and impactful. He knew exactly how to push me when I needed it and how to support me when I doubted myself.

Looking back, I can't imagine going through this journey without Manoj Sir and CAT2iim. His classes  were more than just lessons—they were the foundation of my success. If you’re serious about your MBA dreams, CAT2IIM is where you need to be.`,
